doc_2 = "{{Cleanup|date=November 2006}}\n:: ''For other uses see [[Dressmaker (disambiguation)]]''\n\nA '''dressmaker''' is a person who makes custom [[clothing]] for women, such as [[Dress|dress]]es, [[blouse]]s, and [[gown|evening gown]]s.  Also called a '''mantua-maker''' (historically) or a '''modiste'''.\n\n==History of dressmaking==\nThe [[Oxford English Dictionary]] first records ''dressmaker'' in [[1803]].  Throughout the [[nineteenth century]] and until the rise of [[ready-to-wear]], most women who did not make their own clothes at home employed a dressmaker, who copied or adapted the latest [[clothing]] ideas from [[Paris]], [[London]] or other fashion centres, based on printed [[illustrations]] called [[fashion plate]]s.\n\nA dressmaker is often professionally trained.  Many learn in an apprentice role, under the tutelage of an established dressmaker, while some learn in formal school settings.  Still others learn through years of trial and error. Dressmaking methods involve measurements, a trial garment, called a \"muslin\" or \"toile\", and several fittings.\n\nLauded among the most creative dressmakers of the early 1990s were [[Paul Poiret]], the [[Callot Soeurs]], [[Madeleine Vionnet]], [[Coco Chanel]] and [[Elsa Schiaparelli]]. These visionaries ushered in a new era in dressmaking, quite different from the elaborate, constricting dresses of the 19th century. A dressmaker must be skilled at design, planning, cutting, sewing, fitting, pressing, emebllishing, and finishing.\n\nToday, custom dressmakers fill a niche between [[haute couture]] and ready-to-wear, and are often employed for one-of-a-kind [[special occasion]] dresses, such as [[wedding gown]]s and [[prom]] dresses. Custom dressmakers also create clothing for clients with unique needs, such as performers, artists, disabled or wheelchair-bound, wearers of prosthetic devices, vintage or fashion-forward afficianados, and historical reenactors.  They can also recreate, redesign, and reinvent existing garments (such as updating a great-grandmother's gown for modern day use). Some have very specific specialties, such as embroidery, reweaving, and restoring garments. Some are designers who can create a garment entirely \"from scratch\", and some require a pattern or an existing garment to use as a guide.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Fashion design]]\n*[[Fashion designer]]\n*[[Tailor]]\n*[[Seamstress]]\n*[[Haute Couture]]\n*[[Bespoke]]\n\n==Other Notable dressmakers==\n*[[Charles Frederick Worth]]\n*[[Isabel Toledo]]\n\n==Related terms==\n\n* ''Dressmaker'' as an [[adjective]] denotes clothing made in the [[fashion|style]] of a dressmaker, frequently in the term ''dressmaker details'' which includes [[ruffle]]s, [[frill]]s, [[ribbon]] or [[braid]] [[trim (clothing)|trim]].

She or he may work out of her home, a studio, or retail shop, and may work part-time or full-time. She or he may be any or all or the following sub-specialities:\n\n*'''A Custom Clothier''' makes custom garments one at a time, to order, to meet an individual customer's needs and preferences.\n\n*'''A Custom Dressmaker''' specializes in women's custom apparel, including day dresses, careerwear, suits, evening or bridal wear, sportswear, or lingerie.\n\n*'''A Tailor''' makes custom menswear-style jackets and the skirts or trousers that go with them, for men or women. \n\n*'''An Alterations Specialist, or Alterationist''' adjusts the fit of completed garments, usually ready-to-wear, or restyles them. Note that while all tailors can do alterations, by no means can all alterationists do tailoring.\n\n*'''Designers''' choose combinations of line, proportion, color, and texture for intended garments. They may have no sewing or patternmaking skills, and may only sketch or conceptualize garments.\n\n*'''Patternmakers'''  flat draft the shapes and sizes of the numerous pieces of  a garment by hand using paper and measuring tools or by computer using AutoCAD based software, or by draping muslin on a dressform.\n\n*'''A Wardrobe Consultant or Fashion Advisor''' recommends styles and colors for a client.\n\n*'''A Seamstress''' is someone who sews seams, or in other words, a machine operator in a factory who may not have the skills to make garments from scratch or to fit them on a real body. This term is not a synonym for ''dressmaker''.\n\n*'''A Sewist''' is a relatively new term, combining the words \"sew\" and \"artist\", to describe someone who creates sewn works of art, which can include clothing or other items made with sewn elements.\n\n==References==\n\nDeckert, Barbara: ''Sewing for Plus Sizes: Design, Fit and Construction for Ample Apparel'', Taunton, 1999, ''Appendix B: How to Find, Select, and Work With a Custom Clothier'', pp. 142-143.\n\nPicken, Mary Brooks: ''The FashionDictionary'', Funk and Wagnalls, 1957.\n\nKirke, Betty: \"Madeleine Vionnet\", Chronicle Books, 1998.\n\nButterick Publishing Company: \"The Art of Garment Cutting, Fitting and Making\", 1894.\n\n\n{{sewing}}\n[[Category:Fashion occupations]]\n[[Category:Sewing]]\n[[Category:Artisans]]"

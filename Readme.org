* Methodological notes
The estimates of the oews estimates are calculated for a specific month (in our case I selected only the ones for May) but they rely on the 6 most recent surveys (2 per year) to produce an estimate.

#+begin_quote
The May 2019 employment and wage estimates were calculated using data collected in the May 2019, November 2018, May 2018, November 2017, May 2017, and November 2016 semi-annual panels.

#+end_quote

Since we still have yearly estimates for labour statistic we use the edits accumulated edits in the 12 months up to and including the month of the estimate.
For May 2012 we count the edits starting with June 2011 ending with May 2012
